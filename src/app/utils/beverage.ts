    description: `Apricots Soaked is a popular drink in Vietnam, especially during the hot
        summer days. It is a refreshing beverage that combines sour tamarind and
        preserved plums (xí muội), with shaved ice, creating a flavorful,
        refreshing taste. The typical preparation involves tamarind juice (made
        from fresh or dried tamarind), mixed with xí muội to add a unique
        salty-sweet flavor, and shaved ice to cool it down. Some versions may
        also include sugar or honey to adjust the sweetness, or even a bit of
        chili to add an interesting spicy kick. This drink is not only delicious
        but also very easy to enjoy, offering a refreshing and cooling sensation
        from the tamarind and xí muội, making it especially appealing on hot,
        sunny days.`,
